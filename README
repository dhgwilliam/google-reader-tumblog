google reader shared items import and display script based on sinatra and redis


requires haml, sass, redis, json, bundler, sinatra (obv)

STEP 0
- set up passenger and a new vhost for your tumblog
- set up all required gems
  $ bundle install

STEP 1
Download your Google Reader shared items JSON in Google format
- http://reader.google.com
- click on the gear in the upper right hand corner and select "Reader settings"
- click on Import/Export tab
- Download the "Items you have shared" *READER JSON* (this is very important)
- save in the same folder as the parse.rb script

STEP 2
- once redis is set up, confirm the json variable has the correct filename, then run
  $ ruby parse.rb
- this may take a little while depending on the volume of your shares

STEP 3
- if passenger isn't set up properly, I can wait
- force passenger to reload the code
  $ touch tmp/restart.txt

I don't know, does this work for you?
